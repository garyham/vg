            <img class="feature-image" src="/assets/images/blog/blog-details-image.jpg" alt="blog-details-image"/> <h3>Black Lines brand identity, by &amp; Smith</h3>
<p>Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.</p>
<ul>
<li>ROFL means Rolling on floor laughing.</li>
<li>STFU means Shut the <em>freak</em> up.</li>
<li>LMK means Let me know.</li>
<li>ILY means I love you.</li>
<li>YOLO means You only live once.</li>
<li>SMH means Shaking my head.</li>
</ul>
<p>The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio &amp; Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to &amp; Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.</p>
